# Berkshire Demo
Hello, this is an app I made for an interview.  The purpose of this app is to show a full stack app build even if the app is fairly simple.

##API
The API is written in .NET 4.6.1 and should demonstrate the following:
- Ability to add swagger, and return objects back in json
- Ability to create controllers, services and models
- Ability to create unit tests on services

##APP
The APP is written on Angular 8 and should demonstrate the following:
- Ability to create proxy for development
- Ability to create routing
- Ability to create components, models, and services
- Ability to call APIs from the API project
- Ability to show basic angular functions like ngFor, and ngIF 
- Ability to get two components to work together

# To Run APP
